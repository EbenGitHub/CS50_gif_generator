# CS50_gif_generator
This program uses python language and PIL module to combine static gifs into animating gifs

/How it works
#1 pass all gif files as command-line argument when running the program with python
#2 Boom! check out a new costumes gif file

Thank you @DavidJMalan and all @CS50Team for this amazing python course
